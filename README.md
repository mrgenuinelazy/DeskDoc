ABOUT THE APP: Every urban patient can connect to the doctor very easily. But what about the patients in the remote areas? Doctor's support is a luxury for them. This application aims at making doctor's consultance easily available for the people at the remote places. It makes people ask queries about their health issues by giving all the required information to the doctor online.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES: DeskDoc ranks the doctors according to the number of cases they solve. More the cases doctors solve, better is their ranking on DeskDoc. DeskDoc ranks the doctors on a weekly basis. It calculates the number of cases the doctors solve every time they log in. For every single case that is solved, the weekly activity increases by 1. The previous week's maximum weekly activity tops the list for the next week. The patients who log on to this site can also view the schedule of the doctors. They can view the time range till which the doctors are available along with their consultancy days in the week. Using these references, the patient can choose the doctor who is most suitable for him. Moreover, the application will be available in local languages. This would make it easier for the people in the rural areas to use it.

ADVANTAGES: Accessibility in remote areas. It supports the comfort of the doctors as well as the patients. It helps for fast diagnosis, in case of urgency. Visiting a doctor can sometimes be of no use when the test results are negative. There is no proceedure of writing a prescription. This saves paper. Due to the reduction in the number of people who go to the hospital, the number of vehicles used are reduced and it thus reduces the carbon footprint.
